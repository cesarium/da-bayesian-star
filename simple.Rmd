```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## What's the use

Do LaTeX commands work in here? $\vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a}$ seems nice and it even gives a preview.

But what happens if we switch lines?


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:a

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the. What if we just add some text and delete a word?

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
